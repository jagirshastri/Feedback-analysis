# Feedback analysis
This is a web based application used for feedback collection and analysis of college/school etc.. mainly we have used php,html,css,and java

first start your xampp server and import test1.sql then just put all these folder in htdocs and configure php mailfunction.php file with your original username and password also the mail.php file in admin. 
donot forget to turn on the less secure apps on your account and also turn off antivirus as it stops sending mail from your device for otp.
you are ready to fire the web application... search loaclhost/myproject/home.html
